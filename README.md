# EnumerateMate
Tool for automating server enumeration, requires Kali Linux

I recently took the OSCP course and decided to create a tool to help run basic enumeration on hosts. When engaging a host I would generally first use nmap to discover services and then use tools that were made to target that specific service. My goal is to automate the use of those tools and have EnumerateMate spit out a comprehensive report of findings along with a checklist of recommendations to investigate further. 
Obviously this is going to be a work in progress as there will always be more recommendations to add.
